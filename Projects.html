        <h2>Project: Development of Drive Cycle for Three-Wheelers in Chennai City</h2>
        <p class="project-description">
            I spearheaded the 'Development of Drive Cycle for Three-Wheelers in Chennai City,' a comprehensive project aimed at constructing an accurate drive cycle. Utilizing an Onboard Diagnosis (OBD) tool integrated with the OBD Fusion application, I gathered real-time speed and time data during vehicle operation.
            The collected data, formatted in CSV, underwent meticulous cleaning to remove unnecessary elements. Through Python programming, I implemented a micro-trip selection process to extract essential kinematic parameters. Iterating through obtained micro-trips, I pinpointed representative values by aligning with the average values for each trip type.
            These representative driving cycles were then seamlessly combined to form an authentic drive cycle specific to Chennai city. The final step involved a thorough comparison with standard drive cycles, allowing for precise evaluations of fuel consumption and exhaust emissions under particular area conditions.
            This project showcased my proficiency in data collection, analysis, and Python programming, highlighting my commitment to innovative solutions in environmental and transportation studies.
